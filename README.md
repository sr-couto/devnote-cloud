## Intro

DevNote is a `PWA` (Progressive Web App) for creating notes that uses the local storage capabilities of browsers to work without needing an internet connection after first load.

## Local Installation

```bash\"
git clone https://github.com/santuan/devnote
npm install
```

```bash\"
"scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "lint": "eslint --fix",
    "devnote": "npm run build && npm run preview"
  },
```

### Developer mode
```bash\"
npm run dev
```

### Production mode

```bash\"
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Disclaimer: This is way beyond my understanding :)

### Developer mode on StackBlitz (Experimental)

<a href="https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/santuan/devnote?startScript=devnote">
  <img
    alt="Open in StackBlitz in developer mode"
    src="https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg"
  />
</a>

<br/>

### Production mode on StackBlitz

Add `?startScript=devnote` to the StackBlitz url  


`https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/santuan/devnote?startScript=devnote`


<br/>

<a href="https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/santuan/devnote?startScript=devnote">
  <img
    alt="Open in StackBlitz in production mode"
    src="https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz_small.svg"
  />
</a>

<br/>

Search for the `Open in a new tab` button and then click `connect to project` on the new created tab.

After that I suppose an indexdedDb is created on your Stackblitz session with it's own container in your own browser.

Something like this:

`https://devnote-????--4173--????????.[this i don't now how is generated].webcontainer.io/`

### Fix Eslint and tailwind warning on vscode.

When using @apply (kind of its own language) eslint gives a warning.
